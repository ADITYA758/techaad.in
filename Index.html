                A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
                <br>
                Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks.
                <br>
                 A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and 
                peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation.
                <br>
                This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and 
                function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

                A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems.
                <br>
                Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones.
                <br>
                Computers power the Internet, which links hundreds of millions of other computers and users.

                Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. 
                <br>
                Simple manual instruments like the abacus have aided people in doing calculations since ancient times.
                <br>
                Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms.
                <br>
                More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
                <br>
                The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.
                <br>
                The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s.
                <br>
                The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
